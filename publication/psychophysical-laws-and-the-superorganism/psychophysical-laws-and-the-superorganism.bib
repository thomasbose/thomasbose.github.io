abstract = {Through theoretical analysis, we show how a superorganism may react to stimulus variations according to psychophysical laws observed in humans and other animals. We investigate an empirically-motivated honeybee house-hunting model, which describes a value-sensitive decision process over potential nest-sites, at the level of the colony. In this study, we show how colony decision time increases with the number of available nests, in agreement with the Hick-Hyman law of psychophysics, and decreases with mean nest quality, in agreement with Pi{\'{e}}ron's law. We also show that colony error rate depends on mean nest quality, and difference in quality, in agreement with Weber's law. Psychophysical laws, particularly Weber's law, have been found in diverse species, including unicellular organisms. Our theoretical results predict that superorganisms may also exhibit such behaviour, suggesting that these laws arise from fundamental mechanisms of information processing and decision-making. Finally, we propose a combined psychophysical law which unifies Hick-Hyman's law and Pi{\'{e}}ron's law, traditionally studied independently; this unified law makes predictions that can be empirically tested.},
