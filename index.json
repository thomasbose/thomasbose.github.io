In our study, we addressed this coupling between physiological states and a decision-making circuit in the context of foraging decisions. We considered a model animal that has the drive to eat or drink. The motivation to select and perform one of these activities (i.e. eating or drinking), is processed in artificial neuronal units that have access to information on how hungry and thirsty the animal is at the point it makes the decision. We showed that inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms in the neural circuit shape ongoing binary decisions, and we revealed under which conditions oscillating motivations may improve the overall performance of the animal. Our results indicate that inefficient decision making may originate from suboptimal modulation of excitation and inhibition in the neurobiological network.\nRepresentative publication:\n T. Bose, A.

The results can be derived analytically and thus can be used to verify MuMoT\u0026rsquo;s output.\nThis is an educational example of to derive and work with a multivariate Master equation. It describes a chemical reaction in an open system and involves two reactants, $X$ and $Y$.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nModel definition and basic model exploration model1 = mumot.parseModel(r\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; (A) -\u0026gt; X : \\alpha X + X -\u0026gt; Y + \\emptyset : \\gamma Y -\u0026gt; (B) : \\beta \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)  The above input cell defines our model. If you went through the Getting started tutorial before you will have noticed the different way to define a model. Here, the advantage is that we do not need an absolute cell reference as in the other example. Note we did two steps in one - defining and parsing our model1.\nTo see the reactions in a nicer format, let\u0026rsquo;s look at them with the show() command:\nmodel1.show()  $\\displaystyle (A) \\xrightarrow{\\alpha}X $\n$\\displaystyle X + X \\xrightarrow{\\gamma}Y + \\emptyset $\n$\\displaystyle Y \\xrightarrow{\\beta}(B) $\nHere we have told MuMoT that $A$ and $B$ are constant reactants by putting them in parentheses, and the $\\emptyset$-symbol indicates that we have an open system.\nWe can now derive the ODEs governing the deterministic dynamics of the system using \u0026hellip;\nmodel1.showODEs(method='vanKampen')  $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{d t} \\Phi_X := \\Phi_A \\alpha - 2 \\Phi_X^2 \\gamma$\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{d t} \\Phi_Y := \\Phi_X^2 \\gamma - \\Phi_Y \\beta$\nThis is a bit different than what you have seen in the Getting started tutorial tutorial. Here we used the keyword method='vanKampen'. The effect of this is that the ODEs are derived via a van Kampen expansion (or system size expansion). We will get back to this later. To compare with the default method we can simply omit the keyword and use \u0026hellip;\nmodel1.showODEs()  $\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}Y}{\\textrm{d}t} := X^{2} \\gamma - Y \\beta$\n$\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}X}{\\textrm{d}t} := A \\alpha - 2 X^{2} \\gamma$\nYou can see that the only difference is the symbol $\\Phi$, which denotes concentrations throughout MuMoT. Concentrations or proportions are the quantities naturally arising from the van Kampen expansion.\nTo get an idea of what the dynamics in the system look like, we can numerically integrate the ODEs \u0026hellip;\nevol1 = model1.integrate(initWidgets={'initialState': {'X': [0.5,0,1,0.1], 'Y': [0.5,0,1,0.1]}, 'maxTime': [5,3,20,1]}, legend_loc='center right')    At this point, you might want to play with sliders and see how the plot changes. Also, you could investigate the expression in the input cell and check the effect in the Advanced options tab. Right, we changed the values on the slider. For more information on the options available, we refer to the comprehensive User Manual available on the MuMoT project page on GitHub or alternatively via this link on MyBinder (no installation necessary). Also note that we ticked the Plot population proportions box in the Advanced options tab.\nNext, we might be interested to get some information on the fluctuations in the system. Remember the numerical integration in the plot above relates to the macroscopic equations that do not contain any noise. It describes how the system evolves on avarage. However, depending on the system size fluctuations may be non-negligible (the smaller the system size the larger the fluctuations).\nVan Kampen expansion Our first step to study noise inthe system is to derive the chemical Master equation, i.e. we ask MuMoT to do this calculation for us using \u0026hellip;\nmodel1.showMasterEquation()  $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} P{\\left (X,Y,t \\right )}:= \\frac{A \\alpha}{\\overline{V}} ( \\operatorname{E_{op}}{\\left (X,-1 \\right )} - 1 ) \\overline{V} P{\\left (X,Y,t \\right )} + \\gamma ( \\operatorname{E_{op}}{\\left (X,2 \\right )} \\operatorname{E_{op}}{\\left (Y,-1 \\right )} - 1 ) \\frac{X \\left(X - 1\\right)}{\\overline{V}} P{\\left (X,Y,t \\right )} + \\beta ( \\operatorname{E_{op}}{\\left (Y,1 \\right )} - 1 ) Y P{\\left (X,Y,t \\right )}$\nIn MuMoT we express the Master equation using step operators $E_{op}$, just as in van Kampen\u0026rsquo;s textbook. To derive expressions for the noise in the system, we make use of the linear noise approximation to derive a multivariate Fokker-Planck equation which is linear in the noise terms. This often cumbersome calculation can be automatically performed in MuMoT as follows:\nmodel1.showFokkerPlanckEquation()  $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )} := \\frac{\\Phi_A \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\eta_X^{2}} P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )}}{2} + 2 \\Phi_X^{2} \\gamma \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\eta_X^{2}} P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )} + \\frac{\\Phi_X^{2} \\gamma \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\eta_Y^{2}} P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )}}{2} - 2 \\Phi_X^{2} \\gamma \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\eta_Y\\partial \\eta_X} P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )} + 4 \\Phi_X \\eta_X \\gamma \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta_X} P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )} - 2 \\Phi_X \\eta_X \\gamma \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta_Y} P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )} + 4 \\Phi_X \\gamma P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )} + \\frac{\\Phi_Y \\beta \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\eta_Y^{2}} P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )}}{2} + \\beta \\eta_Y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta_Y} P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )} + \\beta P{\\left (\\eta_X,\\eta_Y,t \\right )}$\nThis expression is indeed identical to the analytical expression in van Kampens book (1981, p.275, Eq.(5.7)). In MuMoT we use the reserved symbol $\\eta$ to represent noise and the index indicates the subsystem of reactants associated with it.\nBrilliant! With just pressing a button the equation was derived in no time.\nAlthough solving partial differential equations is not yet supported in MuMoT, we can do more useful stuff with the linear Fokker-Planck equation. For example, we can automatically derive the equations for the first- and second order moments \u0026hellip;\nmodel1.showNoiseEquations()  $\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}\\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt;}{\\textrm{d}t} := - 4 \\Phi_{X} \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt; \\gamma$\n$\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}\\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{Y}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt;}{\\textrm{d}t} := 2 \\Phi_{X} \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt; \\gamma - \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{Y}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt; \\beta$\n$\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}\\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X}^{2}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt;}{\\textrm{d}t} := \\Phi_{A} \\alpha + 4 \\Phi_{X}^{2} \\gamma - 8 \\Phi_{X} \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X}^{2}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt; \\gamma$\n$\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}\\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X} \\eta_{Y}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt;}{\\textrm{d}t} := - 2 \\Phi_{X}^{2} \\gamma + 2 \\Phi_{X} \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X}^{2}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt; \\gamma - \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X} \\eta_{Y}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt; \\left(4 \\Phi_{X} \\gamma + \\beta\\right)$\n$\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}\\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{Y}^{2}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt;}{\\textrm{d}t} := \\Phi_{X}^{2} \\gamma + 4 \\Phi_{X} \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X} \\eta_{Y}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt; \\gamma + \\Phi_{Y} \\beta - 2 \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{Y}^{2}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt; \\beta$\nand try to compute their solutions in the stationary state \u0026hellip;\nmodel1.showNoiseSolutions()  Stationary solutions of first and second order moments of noise:  $\\displaystyle \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{Y}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt;(t \\to \\infty):= 0$\n$\\displaystyle \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt;(t \\to \\infty):= 0$\n$\\displaystyle \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X}^{2}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt;(t \\to \\infty) := \\frac{\\Phi_{A} \\alpha}{8 \\Phi_{X} \\gamma} + \\frac{\\Phi_{X}}{2}$\n$\\displaystyle \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{Y}^{2}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt;(t \\to \\infty) := \\frac{\\Phi_{A} \\Phi_{X} \\alpha \\gamma + \\Phi_{X}^{2} \\beta \\gamma + 4 \\Phi_{X} \\Phi_{Y} \\beta \\gamma + \\Phi_{Y} \\beta^{2}}{2 \\beta \\left(4 \\Phi_{X} \\gamma + \\beta\\right)}$\n$\\displaystyle \\left\u0026lt; \\vphantom{Dg}\\right.\\eta_{X} \\eta_{Y}\\left. \\vphantom{Dg}\\right\u0026gt;(t \\to \\infty) := \\frac{\\frac{\\Phi_{A} \\alpha}{4} - \\Phi_{X}^{2} \\gamma}{4 \\Phi_{X} \\gamma + \\beta}$\nIf the equations are not too complicated, MuMoT can successfully derive analytical expressions, as in this example. We can also visualise the temporal evolution of noise-noise correlations using the following command:\nNcorr1 = model1.noiseCorrelations(maxTime=3, legend_loc='upper right', legend_fontsize=12)    Fantastic! This produces a publication-ready figure with automatic labelling and legend generation (check the keywords in the input cell, too). Auto-correlations ($\\eta_X(t) \\eta_X(0)$ and $\\eta_Y(t) \\eta_Y(0)$) as well as cross-correlations ($\\eta_X(t) \\eta_Y(0)$ and $\\eta_Y(t) \\eta_X(0)$) are plotted.\nMore information can be found in the MuMoT User Manual (a Jupyter notebook).

Then everything went well with the installation and the import of MuMoT. As you can see, the about() command gives some further details.\nDefining your first model  MuMoT models are defined using the %%model keyword within a cell. The syntax is meant to be intuitive and all processes are described as chemical reaction-like expressions, including the reactants and reaction rates. Here is an example:\nA + A -\u0026gt; A + U: s\nwhere two particles of type $A$ interact, and one changes to type $U$, at rate $s$.\nThis means, reaction rules are quite general. Hence, MuMoT may be used to study a variety of different models that are based on interacting particels or agents. Our first model will be based on signalling behaviour observed in honeybee swarms, as described and modelled in Seeley et al. (2012) and Pais et al.

There are several spontaneous and interaction transitions with rates given as the last parameter in each line after the :.\nThe reaction rules should also be visible underneath the input cell. Following the model definition we need to parse the model so that we can work with it. This can be done with the parseModel command. In our example we can simply use:\nmodel1 = mumot.parseModel(In[2])  This creates the model instance model1 but does not produce any output. The cell reference In[2] is a necessary link to the cell in which the model was defined.\nModel exploration  Now that we have a working model we can do some basic exploration. So, let MuMoT generate the set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) of our model1 for us.\nmodel1.showODEs()  $\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}A}{\\textrm{d}t} := - A B s + A U r_A - A a_A + U g_A$\n$\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}U}{\\textrm{d}t} := 2 A B s - A U r_A + A a_A - B U r_B + B a_B - U g_A - U g_B$\n$\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}B}{\\textrm{d}t} := - A B s + B U r_B - B a_B + U g_B$\nWe can analyse these equations further but before we do that let\u0026rsquo;s simplify them. One equation is redundant here because there is a constant number of individuals in the swarm during a decision, i.e. the system is conserved.\nA simpler set of equations can be obtained using substitute() according to\nmodel2 = model1.substitute('U = N - A - B')  To see that this indeed simplifies the ODEs we do (note that we created the new instance model2) \u0026hellip;\nmodel2.showODEs()  $\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}A}{\\textrm{d}t} := - A B s - A a_A + A r_A \\left(- B + \\left(- A + N\\right)\\right) + g_A \\left(- B + \\left(- A + N\\right)\\right)$\n$\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\frac{\\textrm{d}B}{\\textrm{d}t} := - A B s - B a_B + B r_B \\left(- B + \\left(- A + N\\right)\\right) + g_B \\left(- B + \\left(- A + N\\right)\\right)$\n\u0026hellip; and see that the number of equations was reduced from three to two. This is because the population of uncommitted bees has been replaced by $U=N-A-B$, where $N$ is the total number of bees which is a constant.\nNow we can turn to more exciting graphical output and numerically integrate the ODEs using the MuMoT-method integrate()\nint1 = model2.integrate()    This should have created an interactive plot of the temporal evolution of populations over time. There are some sliders above the figure to manipulate this graph; MuMoT gives you a slider for every rate in the model, and by changing their values, you can see what happens to the behaviour of the system. There are more sliders in the Advanced options tab which you can try out.\nImportant information related to this plot can be retrieved be showing the logs with the showLogs command like so:\nint1.showLogs(tail = True)  Showing last 3 of 3 log entries: Starting numerical integration of ODE system with parameters (a_{A}=2.0), (a_{B}=2.0), (g_{A}=2.0), (g_{B}=2.0), (r_{A}=2.0), (r_{B}=2.0), (s=2.0), (initA=1.0), (initB=0.0), (initU=0.0), (maxTime=3.0), (conserved=True), (substitutedReactant=U), at 2019-04-05 17:49:23.730840 Last point on curve:  $\\displaystyle A(t =3.0) = 3.4121$\n$\\displaystyle B(t =3.0) = 3.255$\nAs last part of this short introductory tutorial we will produce a vector of our system. This can be done using:\nvector1 = model2.vector('A', 'B', showNoise = True)    This vector plot depicts how the system evolves depending on the initial conditions. Proportions of bees in states $A$ and $B$ are labelled $\\Phi_A$ and $\\Phi_B$ - we use the upper-case Greek letter $\\Phi$ to denote concentrations (proportions) and the reactants are added as indices. This is done throughout MuMoT and you will encounter this notation again when you work through more examples. Hence, upper-case $\\Phi$ cannot be used as a user-defined symbol in MuMoT to avoid confusion. The green ellipse displays noise in the system due to a finite system size (change the system size slider above the plot and see how the ellipse changes; don\u0026rsquo;t increase the system size too much though, as this may increase computation time).\nAgain, model parameters may be altered via the sliders above the figure and useful information about the computation can be obtained using the showLogs() command:\nvector1.showLogs(tail = True)  Showing last 3 of 3 log entries: Starting 2d vector plot with parameters (a_{A}=2.0), (a_{B}=2.0), (g_{A}=2.0), (g_{B}=2.0), (r_{A}=2.0), (r_{B}=2.0), (s=2.0), (aggregateResults=True), (maxTime=2.0), (randomSeed=1680863739), (runs=20), at 2019-04-05 17:49:30.713976 Fixed point1: A = -1.0000, B = -1.0000, with eigenvalues: 4.0000, 8.0000, and eigenvectors: [-1.0000, 1.0000] and [1.0000, 1.0000] Fixed point2: A = 0.3333, B = 0.3333, with eigenvalues: -8.0000, -1.3333, and eigenvectors: [1.0000, 1.0000] and [-1.0000, 1.0000]  This was just a very short introduction and there is much more to discover.

In this study, we show how colony decision time increases with the number of available nests, in agreement with the Hick-Hyman law of psychophysics, and decreases with mean nest quality, in agreement with Piéron’s law. We also show that colony error rate depends on mean nest quality, and difference in quality, in agreement with Weber’s law. Psychophysical laws, particularly Weber’s law, have been found in diverse species, including unicellular organisms. Our theoretical results predict that superorganisms may also exhibit such behaviour, suggesting that these laws arise from fundamental mechanisms of information processing and decision-making.

Provided that the chosen option has an above-threshold quality value, value-sensitive decisions are particularly relevant in case not all of the possible options are available at decision time. This means that the decision-maker may refrain from deciding until a sufficient-quality option becomes available. Value-sensitive collective decisions are interesting for swarm robotics when the options are dispersed in space (e.g., resources in a foraging problem), and may be discovered at different times. However, current design methodologies for collective decision-making often assume a well-mixed system, and clever design workarounds are suggested to deal with a heterogeneous distribution of opinions within the swarm (e.g., due to spatial constraints on the interaction network). Here, we quantify the effects of spatiality in a value-sensitive decision problem involving a swarm of 150 kilobots. We present a macroscopic model of value-sensitive decision-making inspired by house-hunting honeybees, and implement a solution for both a multiagent system and a kilobot swarm. Notably, no workaround is implemented to deal with the spatial distribution of opinions within the swarm. We show how the dynamics presented by the robotic system match or depart from the model predictions in both a qualitative and quantitative way as a result of spatial constraints.","tags":[],"title":"Effects of Spatiality on Value Sensitive Decisions Made by Robot Swarms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

To date, the nest-site selection process has mostly been modeled and theoretically analyzed for the case of binary decisions. However, when the number of alternative nests is larger than two, the decision-process dynamics qualitatively change. In this work, we extend previous analyses of a value-sensitive decision-making mechanism to a decision process among N nests. First, we present the decision-making dynamics in the symmetric case of N equal-quality nests. Then, we generalize our findings to a best-of-N decision scenario with one superior nest and N−1 inferior nests, previously studied empirically in bees and ants. Whereas previous binary models highlighted the crucial role of inhibitory stop-signaling, the key parameter in our new analysis is the relative time invested by swarm members in individual discovery and in signaling behaviors. Our new analysis reveals conflicting pressures on this ratio in symmetric and best-of-N decisions, which could be solved through a time-dependent signaling strategy. Additionally, our analysis suggests how ecological factors determining the density of suitable nest sites may have led to selective pressures for an optimal stable signaling ratio.","tags":[],"title":"Model of the best-of-N nest-site selection process in honeybees","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Considering magnetic insulators with a certain symmetry configuration we found that both the first-order and the second-order electron displacement create current loops that generate the light-induced magnetic fields $B^{(1)}$ and $B^{(2)}$.

During the last decade the concept of the immune surveillance of the body was emphasized again, supported by experimental results verifying the immune surveillance hypothesis. Later on, the immune surveillance concept was modified and is now known as \u0026lsquo;immunoediting\u0026rsquo; which reflects the dual role of the immune response during the early stages of cancer growth. The term immunoediting means both the ability of the immune system to destroy the tumor cells and a possible sculpting of the cancer cells. As the result all cells with a low immunogenicity will survive and begin to proliferate which is often referred to as escape of the tumor from the control of the immune system.\n Schematic of tumor-immune cells interaction after introducing randomness.   Here, we investigate tumor evolution in presence of an intact immune system taking further into account stochasticity to demonstrate that tumor-immune cell reactions can be induced by stochastic forces. To that purpose we consider three types of cells:\n tumor cells the density of which is denoted by $x(t)$, effector cells with density $y(t)$, and tumor-detecting cells with density $z(t)$.  Whereas tumor-detecting cells are only able to recognize tumor cells but not to kill them, the effector cells have the ability to eliminate tumor cells.\nAfter introducing a system of coupled differential equations describing the interaction between different cell species we find that tumor extinction is only observed in the presence of randomness and noise. The mutual interaction of the different kinds of cells is shown in the figure. The quantities in the brackets are mean values derived by a probabilistic treatment of the equations describing the stochastic dynamic system. The parameters of the noise correlation function have a great impact on the behavior of the coupled tumor-immune cell interaction, especially on the response of the immune system. In particular we show that the auto-correlation time and the cross-correlation strength are able to control the evolution of the tumor. More precise, these two quantities discriminate whether the system tends to tumor suppression, tumor progression or tumor dormancy. The assistance of inevitable noisy influences seems to play a crucial role during cancer genesis and growth in humans. The involved random forces may be originated in the tumor as well as inside the immune system and can even interact mutually which is manifested in the cross-correlation.
