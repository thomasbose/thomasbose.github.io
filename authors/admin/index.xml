      <description>I am a Research Fellow in the Behavioural and Evolutionary Theory Lab in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield where I work on the DiODe Project. At present, my research focuses on the theory of collective decision making and the development of computational approaches to explain and describe the underlying mechanisms allowing complex systems to reach consensus. In particular, I am interested in understanding the relationships between external stimuli and their internal representations that drive behavioural choices in perceptual as well as value-based decision-making tasks.</description>
